We encourage you to use [cloud9.io](https://c9.io) to complete this workshop as it's very easy to set up a Nodejs workspace and start coding straight away.

:raising_hand: **If you don't have a cloud9.io account, please let any of the mentors know and we'll send you an invitation to join our group space.**

If you're comfortable setting up your development environment locally, please download Node from the Node.js website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
