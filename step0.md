We encourage you to use [cloud9.io](https://c9.io) to complete this workshop as it's very easy to set up a Nodejs workspace and start coding straight away.

:raising_hand: **If you don't have a cloud9.io account, please let any of the mentors know and we'll send you an invitation to join our group space.**

If you're comfortable setting up your development environment locally, please download Node from the Node.js website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### 2. Fork this repository
Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.  Instructions for doing this can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

#### 3. Create a workspace in Cloud9.io
If you're using [cloud9.io](https://c9.io) create a new workspace. Instructions for doing this can be found [here](https://docs.c9.io/v1.0/docs/create-a-workspace).

:raising_hand: Make sure you:

- Enter the URL to your github forked repo `$ https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/express-workshop`
- Select Node.js as your workspace template

#### 4. Clone the repository in your local environment
If you're working in your local environment, clone your forked version of the repository to your desktop in the terminal. Instructions for doing this can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), or run the command below.

`$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/express-workshop`

This creates an express-workshop directory with the repository content inside. Change into the express-workshop directory, since that's where we'll be working from now on.
