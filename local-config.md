If you want to take the leap of setting things up on your own computer, you will need to do the following:

1. Install Node.js
2. Install an Editor
3. Download the workshop files

### Install Node.js

You can download the Node.js installer from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>  

Download it, run it and follow the prompts.

There are installers for Windows, macOS & Linux.  Linux users should check if their distro includes a Node.js package for easy installation.

The most recent version of Node.js at time of writing is 8.  However any release of 6 or greater should work fine.

Once Node.js is installed, open a terminal and enter the command `node --version` to verify that it is installed correctly.

### Install an Editor

You are going to need a program to write your source code in.  We call that your editor.

Any program that can edit plain text files will work, such as NotePad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS.  You cannot use a word processor like Microsoft Word, Apple's Pages, or OpenOffice.

While NotePad or TextEdit will do the job, you can download free & open-source editors which provide some additional features to make writing program source code a little more pleasant.  

If you are just getting started we recommend [Github's Atom](https://atom.io/)

If you have used Microsoft's Visual Studio before you might like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

These are both free, open-source, and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Download the workshop files 

Now to download the workshop files to your computer.

Go to your the fork of the workshop you created above in Github.  

The URL will be <code>https://github.com/<b>USERNAME</b>/express-workshop-2</code>
