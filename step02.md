# Step 2 - Installing Express

Before we write any code, you'll need to install Express. You can download it from npm using the **`npm install`** command.

As you install Express, you need to update the `package.json`, adding Express as a dependency. This can be done by adding **`--save`** to the end of your command.

Run the following command in your terminal:

`$ npm install express --save`

Express should now be installed. Check your `package.json` file to make sure it has been added as a dependency.
